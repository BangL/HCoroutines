# HCoroutines

HCoroutines is a library that helps you write game logic in an **intuitive** way by bringing the concept of **hierarchical coroutines** to Godot (C#).

It extends the idea of normal coroutines by allowing them to spawn child coroutines. When the parent coroutine is killed, the child coroutines are also stopped.
